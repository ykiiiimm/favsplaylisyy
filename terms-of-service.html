        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><em>Last Updated: January 23, 2025</em></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to UR FAV'S, your portal to a cosmic entertainment universe! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your exploration of our website and services. By entering our orbit, you agree to these Terms. If you disagree, please exit this galaxy.</p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be 13 or older to traverse UR FAV'S. By engaging, you confirm you meet this age requirement and possess the legal capacity to accept these Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>As a cosmic traveler, you agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Refrain from uploading harmful content (e.g., malware, hate speech, explicit material).</li>
            <li>Use UR FAV'S for personal, non-commercial stargazing only.</li>
            <li>Secure your account and not share credentials with other explorers.</li>
            <li>Respect all earthly and cosmic laws during your journey.</li>
            <li>Not misuse features (e.g., spamming, hacking, or reverse-engineering our nebula).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Account Usage</h2>
        <p>Your account is your spaceship—you’re responsible for all activity within it. We may suspend or terminate accounts violating these Terms or engaging in disruptive behavior.</p>

        <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Our cosmic design, code, and content are our stardust, protected by copyright laws. You may not copy, distribute, or modify them without permission, except for personal use within UR FAV'S.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Content</h2>
        <p>We harness TMDB’s galaxy for movie/TV data. You must follow their terms (<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/terms-of-use" target="_blank">TMDB Terms</a>) when interacting with their celestial offerings.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>UR FAV'S is a "as-is" nebula with no warranties. We’re not liable for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Service blackouts or data asteroids.</li>
            <li>Damages from your cosmic travels, where law permits.</li>
            <li>Third-party actions or supernova events beyond our control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may eject you from our orbit for Term violations or at our discretion, with or without notice. You may also abandon ship by deleting your account.</p>

        <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms orbit under the laws of the United States, State of California. Disputes will be resolved in California courts, unless local laws dictate otherwise.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may realign these Terms. Updates will appear here with a new "Last Updated" date. Continuing your journey post-update means you accept the new alignment.</p>
